# image-preprocessing-MATLAB

Image pre-processing using MATLAB GUI is an application that performs pre-processing
operations on a given image, a MATLAB GUI is used as an interface to interact with the
user. The commands are written in MATLAB code.

MATLAB App Designer is used to create the GUI by the means of drag and drop.
The codes of the implementation are written using MATLAB library functions.

The Main focus of the project is to create a system with GUI, which performs image preprocessing.
The Applications are –

• Can be used by anyone, with the help of MATLAB GUI

• A basic system for image pre-processing

• Can be used as an educational resource, to familiarize the concepts

• Pre-processing is necessary operation for all image processing problems
